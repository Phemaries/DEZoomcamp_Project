## Analysis of Flight Delays and Cancellation during COVID-19 in United States

Analyzing flight delay and cancellation metrics can provide insights into the factors contributing to disruptions in airline operations. The data set is provided by The United States Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks on the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. The data collected is from January - June 2020. The data set was sourced [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations/data?select=jantojun2020.csv)

## Problem Description
I analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on flight delays and cancellations during the peak eras of the virus with available datasets from January to June 2020. By understanding the root causes of delays and cancellations, airlines can implement strategies to minimize their impact on customer satisfaction and operational performance.
